## Notes
- The original code from `fakerybakery/claude-code-kimi-groq` remains under its MIT License and copyright as specified above.
- Users of ClaudeKimi must comply with the terms of both licenses for the respective portions of the codebase.
- If this project directly uses the Kimi K2 model weights or API (e.g., via Moonshot AIâ€™s platform), additional terms from the Kimi K2 Modified MIT License may apply, such as displaying "Kimi K2" in the UI for projects exceeding 100 million monthly users or $20 million in monthly revenue. See [MoonshotAI/Kimi-K2](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-K2) for details. If ClaudeKimi only extends the proxy functionality and does not directly use Kimi K2 model weights or API, this requirement does not apply.
